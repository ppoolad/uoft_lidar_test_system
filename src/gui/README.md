Here lies the GUI for the UofT Lidar Test System. The GUI is web based and built using Streamlit.

## Installation
1. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Make sure you have the shared objects built. See the [README](../shared_objects/README.md) in the `shared_objects` directory for instructions on how to build them.
3. Run the GUI:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The URL of the GUI will be printed in the terminal. Open it in your web browser to access the GUI.
